Algorithmic Complexity

	- random access machine
	
	- step
	
	- time constraint
	
	- size of input arbitrarily large or small
	
	- dominant algebraic term of growth, input to running time ratio, input prescribed algebraic term
	
	- running time (actual / conceptual)
	
		- best case, worst case, average case
		
		- lower bound, upper bound
		
	- counting steps, operators, operations, branches, loops, conditionals, recursion, iteration, input size
	
	- O(n)
	
	- theta(n)
	
constant, linear, logarithmic, log-linear, polynomial, exponential, graphing algorithm time to infinity, counting dominant operation and size of input and taking dominant algebraic term
